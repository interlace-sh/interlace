# Outstanding Tasks

**Date:** February 2026
**Scope:** Remaining work items prioritised by impact.

---

## 🔴 High Priority (v0.2.0 Beta)

### 1. API Key Authentication Middleware

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Priority:** High - Production blocker for `interlace serve`

The stream handler already has per-stream bearer/api-key auth (`service/api/handlers/streams.py`). This needs extracting into global middleware.

**Work Required:**
- API key authentication middleware (`service/api/middleware/auth.py`)
- Config via `service.auth` in `config.yaml`
- Whitelist paths (e.g. `/health`)
- Refactor stream-level auth to delegate to shared middleware
- Rate limiting (token bucket, `ErrorCode.RATE_LIMITED` already defined)

**Effort:** Medium (3-4 days)

---

### 2. Quality Check Executor Integration

**Status:** FRAMEWORK EXISTS, WIRING MISSING
**Priority:** High - Framework fully implemented but never called during `interlace run`

The quality check framework (`quality/` module with 6 check types and `QualityCheckRunner`) is complete but disconnected from the execution pipeline.

**Work Required:**
- Add `quality_checks` parameter to `@model()` decorator
- Propagate config-level quality checks to model_info during initialisation
- Call `QualityCheckRunner.run_model_checks()` post-materialisation in `model_executor.py`
- Store quality results in state store (`quality_results` table)
- Surface results in CLI output and API responses
- `--quality-only` flag for running checks without re-materialising

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

---

### 3. OpenAPI/Swagger API Documentation

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Priority:** High - Adoption requirement for Beta

**Work Required:**
- Hand-write `openapi.yaml` for all 20+ endpoints
- Serve Swagger UI at `/api/docs`
- Add routes for docs and openapi.yaml

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority (v1.0 GA)

### 4. Auto-Generated Documentation Site

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Priority:** Medium - Marquee feature for GA (dbt's strongest feature)

**Work Required:**
- `interlace docs build` — static HTML from model metadata, lineage, schema
- `interlace docs serve` — localhost with live reload
- Jinja2 templates for model catalogue, lineage visualisation, schema docs
- Data from StateStore (model_metadata, column_lineage, schema_history)

**Effort:** High (5-7 days)

---

### 5. Migration Rollback Support

**Status:** FORWARD-ONLY IMPLEMENTED
**Priority:** Medium - Production expectation

Forward-only migrations are fully working (`migrations/runner.py`, `migrations/cli.py`). Rollback needs adding.

**Work Required:**
- File convention: `001_description.up.sql` / `001_description.down.sql`
- `interlace migrate --rollback` to run latest down-migration
- `interlace migrate --to N` for targeted rollback
- Extend `migrations/runner.py` and `migrations/cli.py`

**Effort:** Medium (3-4 days)

---

### 6. User Function Discovery

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Priority:** Medium - Documented feature

`interlace init` creates a `functions/` directory. The discovery and registration needs implementing.

**Work Required:**
- Function discovery in `utils/discovery.py`
- Register Python functions as DuckDB UDFs
- Register SQL macros from `.sql` files
- Auto-available in SQL models

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

---

## 🟢 Lower Priority (Post-1.0)

### 7. DuckLake S3/Parquet Storage Layer

**Status:** ARCHITECTURE ONLY
**Priority:** Lower - Cloud-native pattern, niche use case

**Effort:** Medium (2 weeks)

---

### 8. VS Code Extension

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Priority:** Lower - Developer experience enhancement

**Effort:** High (4+ weeks)

---

### 9. Distributed Execution

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Priority:** Lower - Enterprise scale

**Effort:** Very High (6+ weeks)
