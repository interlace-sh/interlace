# Interlace Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for Interlace, organised by phases with priorities and milestones.

## Roadmap Philosophy

The roadmap is organised into phases, with each phase building on previous work:
- **Phase 0-1**: Core foundation (essential for MVP)
- **Phase 2-3**: Enhanced capabilities (production readiness)
- **Phase 4+**: Advanced features (scaling and enterprise features)

**Principles:**
- Build incrementally: Each phase delivers working, usable features
- Production-ready focus: Prioritise stability and observability
- Community-driven: Features driven by real use cases
- Interoperability: Work well with existing data tools

**Status Legend:**
- `[x]` = **Implemented** - Working code exists and is functional
- `[ ]` = **Not Implemented** - Architecture/spec may exist, but no working implementation

---
